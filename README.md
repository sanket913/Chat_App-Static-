# 💬 Chat App (Static)

A modern, responsive, and sleek static chat application UI built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucide Icons**. This project demonstrates my ability to build real-time-like interfaces, manage state efficiently using React hooks, and structure scalable frontend applications.
